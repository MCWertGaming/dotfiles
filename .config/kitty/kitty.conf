## | Performance tuning                              |
## '================================================='

# Delay (in milliseconds) between screen updates
# Decreasing it, increases frames-per-second (FPS) at the cost of more CPU usage
# The default value yields ~100 FPS which is more than sufficient for most uses
# Note that to actually achieve 100 FPS you have to either set sync_to_monitor to no or use a monitor with a high refresh rate
# Also, to minimize latency when there is pending input to be processed, repaint_delay is ignored
repaint_delay 10

# Delay (in milliseconds) before input from the program running in the terminal is processed
# Note that decreasing it will increase responsiveness
# but also increase CPU usage and might cause flicker in full screen programs that redraw
# the entire screen on each loop, because kitty is so fast that partial screen updates will be drawn
input_delay 3

# Sync screen updates to the refresh rate of the monitor
# This prevents tearing when scrolling
# However, it limits the rendering speed to the refresh rate of your monitor
# With a very high speed mouse/high keyboard repeat rate, you may notice some slight input latency
# If so, set this to no.
sync_to_monitor yes
